- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

At first I was hesitant on inheritance, but after using it in practice I really like it. It's easy to change / add things without writing too much of repeating code. So far, I really like this homework and how it walked us through each of the steps. The only thing that was a bit confusing was introducing hashtables and figuring out how to implement them.
